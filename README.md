virtualization, development, etc.

- **bin**: Contains any custom scripts I've made. These are added to the Nix store and system PATH.
  - nix-switch: Convenience nushell script for updating the system, formatting each file with
    nixfmt, and keeping it in sync with a remote repo.
- **images**: Collection of wallpapers.
- **user**: Per-user configs. Mostly home-manager modules.
- **hosts**: Host-specific modules. For things such as setting hostnames and static IPs. Also
  contains each system's hardware-configuration.nix.
- **system**: System-wide modules.
  - baseline: There are baseline configs for server, workstation, gaming-console and HTPC that can
    get you up-and-running quickly. In each baseline are also submodules pertaining to that baseline
    for more specialized functionality.
  - extras: Additional nix tools I've made.
  - hardware: Modules for certain hardware setups, e.g. graphics card drivers, SteamDeck firmware,
    etc.
  - shared: Modules that have functionality which is shared among other modules.

Note that /etc/nixos and all recursive files should be owned by root:wheel to maximize security and for the auto-update service to work.
